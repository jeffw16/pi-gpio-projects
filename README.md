# pi-gpio-projects
My collection of Raspberry Pi projects using the Python library RPi.GPIO.

## List of scripts
- **led.py** - Press the Enter key to turn an LED on or off.
- **ledblink.py** - Making an LED blink over and over again.
- **led2blink.py** - Control two LEDs and make them simultaneously blink by setting the two pins' # (1-40 board style, not Broadcom), interval, and times to blink. The LEDs will blink that many times and then the script will terminate.
- **led2song.py** - Set two LEDs to blink to the beat of a certain song for that song's exact length.
- **rgbyled.py** - RGBY LED controls.
- **ledxblink.py** - Give an x amount of pins and this script will go through them in three different patterns.
