# pi-gpio-projects
My collection of Raspberry Pi projects using the Python library RPi.GPIO.

## List of scripts
- **led2blink.py** - Control two LEDs and make them simultaneously blink by setting the two pins' # (1-40 board style, not Broadcom), interval, and times to blink. The LEDs will blink that many times and then the script will terminate.
